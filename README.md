### DataAnalysisRandom

I just made this to just upload the data preprocessing and EDA done on some kaggle datasets. They might not be widely used dataset, they might as well be new datasets. But yeah, I'm trying to preprocess the datasets and I will upload Jupyter notebooks on the steps I have done on that respective file (csv or excel).

you can use this to create Tableau sheets and dashboards. or can use this to create ML models.
